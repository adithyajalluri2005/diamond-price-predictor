# Diamond Price Predictor ðŸ’Ž

An open-source machine learning application to predict diamond prices based on key attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. This project blends data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask web app for real-time prediction.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
  Load and clean Kaggle's diamonds datasetâ€”remove outliers, handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical ones.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Understand feature relationships with scatterplots, correlation matrices, and violin plots.

- **Model Training & Comparison**  
  Train and evaluate multiple regressors: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, DecisionTree, RandomForest, KNeighbors, GradientBoosting, XGBRegressor. Use metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to pick the best model.

- **Feature Importance**  
  XGBRegressor yields actionable insightsâ€”carat is most important, followed by 'y' dimension, clarity, and color.

- **Web App Deployment**  
  Powered by Flask with a simple front-end (HTML forms + Bootstrap), this interface allows users to input diamond specs and receive predicted price instantly.
